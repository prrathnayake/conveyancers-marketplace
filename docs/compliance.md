# AU Compliance Pointers (quick references)
- ARNECC notes that conveyancers are not permitted to operate in **QLD** or **ACT**; solicitors only. Build role gating per state.
- NSW: Licensed conveyancers must have **professional indemnity** under the approved policy and keep **trust accounts** only at approved ADIs with annual audits.
- Best practice: Use **regulated PSP escrow**; do **not** operate your own trust account unless you become the regulated licensee. This starter integrates via providers.
- Retention: Keep identity evidence for required periods; implement `retention_policy_days` toggles in config.
