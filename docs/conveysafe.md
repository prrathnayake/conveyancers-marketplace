# ConveySafe Assurance Playbook

ConveySafe is the trust and compliance layer that keeps the marketplace safer than going off-platform.

## 1. Platform trust & compliance lock-in
- **Registry-backed verification** – the identity service cross-checks licence numbers and PI insurance against an embedded state registry before a ConveySafe badge can be issued. Failed matches clear the previous verification timestamp and trigger admin alerts.
- **Escrow milestones with evidence** – milestone holds are released through ConveySafe SecurePay so funds remain protected until digital acceptance is recorded.
- **Immutable audit trail** – secure chat, file exchanges, and compliance events are timestamped for legal defensibility, with admin search in both the marketplace and operator console.

## 2. Economic incentives to stay on-platform
- **Tiered loyalty pricing** – ConveySafe rewards conveyancers who complete matters on-platform with progressively lower service fees. Tier data is exposed through `/payments/loyalty/*` endpoints and surfaced in hold creation responses.
- **Faster payouts** – holds routed through SecurePay can be released with instant invoices, keeping cashflow ahead of traditional invoicing cycles.
- **Discount hooks** – platform settings can reference the active loyalty tier for targeted offers or ad boosts.

## 3. Product & UX lock-in
- **ConveySafe document room** – in-app signing, secure uploads, and milestone checklists replace ad-hoc email threads.
- **Policy-aware messaging** – chat routes detect emails, phone numbers, and off-platform phrases, inserting a ConveySafe reminder and creating a policy flag for compliance review.
- **AI-ready surfaces** – structured compliance badges and audit metadata give future AI assistants the context they need to automate contract reviews.

## 4. Policy & enforcement
- **Terms enforcement** – policy flags and licence registry updates are written to the audit log so TOS violations can be escalated quickly.
- **Badge visibility** – only conveyancers with current ConveySafe verification display the badge across search, profile, and marketing copy.
- **Insurance monitoring** – expiring or malformed policy dates create admin alerts, prompting remediation before work continues.

## 5. Long-term network effects
- **Verified reputation** – ConveySafe badges and loyalty tiers show clients who consistently close compliant settlements.
- **Data insights** – loyalty summaries, checkout metrics, and compliance alerts feed dashboards for marketplace operators.
- **Integrated ecosystem** – escrow, chat, and compliance operate together so breaking the chain off-platform removes tangible value.

Use this playbook when expanding compliance automations, writing marketing copy, or briefing partners on the ConveySafe story.
