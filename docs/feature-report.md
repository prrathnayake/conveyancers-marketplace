## Key Recommendations

1. Automate compliance signals—wire external KYC, licence registries, and signature providers into the existing admin endpoints so approvals and certificate issuance are auditable.
2. Replace in-memory fixtures with persistent adapters for profiles, jobs, documents, and payments so that observability and retention controls become meaningful.
3. Layer PSP settlement, invoicing, and anti-virus/document retention services to meet the regulated experience outlined in the requirements.
